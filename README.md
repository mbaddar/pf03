## 📚 Repository Structure

The bootcamp is organized by **weeks**, each focusing on a specific stage of the AI / data lifecycle.

Each weekly folder contains:
- Lecture materials
- Hands-on exercises
- A weekly project
- A dedicated `README.md` with detailed instructions

---

## 📖 Viewing the Slides & Materials

All instructional content is written using **Quarto** (`.qmd` files).

### To view the slides and notebooks locally:

1. **Download and install Quarto**  
   👉 https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/

2. Run:

   ```bash
   quarto preview slides
   ```

This will launch a local preview server where you can view the slides and rendered materials in your browser.

## 🎯 Learning Philosophy

This bootcamp emphasizes:

* **Foundations before frameworks**
* **Understanding before automation**
* **Clean data before clever models**
* **Reproducibility and documentation**
* **Professional workflows used in industry**

You are expected to think critically about:

* Design decisions
* Tradeoffs
* Assumptions
* Data quality
* Model limitations

## 🧠 Generative AI Usage Policy

Generative AI tools are treated as **learning aids**, not substitutes for thinking.

* ✅ Allowed:

  * Concept explanations
  * Debugging help
  * Clarifying errors and syntax

* ❌ Not allowed:

  * Auto-generating full solutions
  * Copy-pasting project code
  * Skipping reasoning or interpretation

Every submission should reflect **your understanding**, not just working code.

---

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

1. Start with **Week 1** and proceed sequentially
2. Read each week’s `README.md` carefully
3. Run all examples locally
4. Commit your work regularly
5. Treat weekly projects as real deliverables

This repo is meant to grow with you as your skills grow.
